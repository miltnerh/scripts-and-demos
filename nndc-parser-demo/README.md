## NNDC Parser Utility

Usage of `nndc_parser.py` module to translate NNDC CSV files from complicated format to tables per gamma emission, primarily for the LISE++ `Isomer_DB.sqlite` file.

Users can implement this module for their own databases as well, but the code is idealized for the `Isomer_DB.sqlite` formatting.
